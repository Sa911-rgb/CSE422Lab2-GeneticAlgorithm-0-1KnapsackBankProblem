# 0/1 Knapsack Bank Problem using Genetic Algorithm

Suppose, an owner of a bank has a fascination with finding out whether a portion of the daily transactions (in/out) balance out to zero. For example, suppose the daily transaction register looks like this:

1 Lend 100

2 Deposit 150

3 Lend 400

4 Lend 500

5 Deposit 1000

6 Lend 460

7 Deposit 160

8 Deposit 200

9 Lend 500

10 Deposit 100

In this case, there is a portion of the transactions that would balance itself out. (6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th transactions would amount to 0).
The task is to use a genetic algorithm to solve this bank problem.

Task Breakdown:

Model the transaction register in a way suitable for the problem.
Write a fitness function. Hint: It is the sum of the non-zero elements of a register.
Write the crossover function.
Write the mutation function.
Create a population of randomly generated registers.
Run genetic algorithms on the population until highest fitness has been reached and/or number of maximum iterations has been reached.

Input:

The first line has a number denoting the number of daily transactions followed by lines each starting with either l or d and a number denoting the amount of transaction. Here:

Output:

The output would be a binary string denoting the specific transactions that balance themselves to zero or -1 if such a string cannot be formed. String consisting of all zeros wonâ€™t be accepted.

Example:
